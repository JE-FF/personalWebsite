        <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
        <p id="aboutMeStatement">
          My whole life I've been plugged in and fascinated as computers and the
          internet changed the world. Naturally, I pursued a career in IT and I
          became a technician for family entertainment centers where I repaired
          arcade games and administrated small office / home office
          infrastructure.<br /><br />

          I stepped away from IT for a few years to learn more about the world
          and about myself. I did an Americorps service year, then I worked as a
          medical assistant and nurse's aide. I had chosen to pursue nursing
          informatics as a career that would combine my passions for IT and
          helping others. I was attended nursing school pursuant that goal until
          the pandemic put a stop to that! Now, I've reoriented and am studying
          IT and development more generally. I am currently enrolled in a
          bachelors program for software development, and I am also attending
          SavvyCoders Bootcamp. I joined Savvy Coders to help me develop the
          skills that I need to jump into the job market right away.<br /><br />

          My Savvy Coders capstone was inspired by my Americorps experience
          building community gardens to mitigate food insecurity in communities
          across the country. I am building a platform for gardeners to sell
          their home-grown produce, and for consumers to purchase fresh food
          from their neighbors.
