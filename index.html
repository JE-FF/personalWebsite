            <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
                <p id="aboutMeStatement">
                    My whole life I've been plugged in and fascinated as computers and the internet changed the world.
                    Naturally, I pursued a career in IT and I became a technician for family entertainment centers
                    where I repaired arcade games and administrated SOHO type infrastructure.<br><br>

                    I stepped away from IT for a few years to learn more about the world and about myself.
                    I did an Americorps service year, then I worked as a medical assistant and nurse's aide.
                    I had chosen to pursue nursing informatics as a career that would combine my passions
                    for IT and helping others. I was attended nursing school pursuant that goal until the pandemic
                    put a stop to that! Now, I've reoriented and am studying IT and development more generally.
                    I am currently enrolled in a bachelors program for software development, and I am also
                    attending SavvyCoders Bootcamp. I joined Savvy Coders to help me develop the skills
                    that I need to jump into the job market right away.<br><br>

                    My Savvy Coders capstone was inspired by my Americorps experience building community
                    gardens to mitigate food insecurity in communities across the country.
                    I am building a platform for gardeners to sell their home-grown produce,
                    and for consumers to purchase fresh food from their neighbors.
