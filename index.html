            <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p id="aboutMeStatement">
                    From the age of 7 I have always had my own personal computer because my dad's 
                    work would give away their outdated computers to the employees. I've used MacOS
                    since System 7 on my dad's 98 powerbook, I've used every version of Windows 
                    since 95, and Linux has been my OS of choice on my personal machines for the last 
                    10 years. My whole life I've been plugged in, watching computers and the internet 
                    change the world.<br><br>
                    
                    Naturally, I pursued IT and I was a technician at Main Event Entertainment where I 
                    helped build their Independence Missouri location. I helped set up and maintain
                    their local IT infrastructure.<br><br>

                    I stepped away from IT for a few years to learn more about the world and about 
                    myself. While I was away from IT I did a service year with Americorps NCCC where I 
                    confronted complex social issues for the first time. I helped build three community 
                    gardens during my service year to help address food insecurity in communities 
                    across the country, and now many schools in Missouri are facing food shortages 
                    owing to the pandemic. This inspired me to build a website that would help 
                    homeowners create community gardens in their own front yards as I practice web 
                    development skills.<br><br>

                    I also wanted to mention that I'm really passionate about humane technology 
                    design - you've probably heard of the controversies surrounding Facebook, Google, 
                    Reddit, and the other social media giants regarding addictive patterning, 
                    polarization, and algorithms prioritizing outrageous or otherwise unhealthy content. 
                    I have been closely following and engaging with the Center for Humane Technology 
                    (CHT), which is really the leading organization in this area. The CHT recently 
                    released a test pilot for a course on humane technology design, and I was one of 
                    the first people to complete the course.<br><br>

                    These communities are really led by technologists actively developing platforms 
                    and services. I want to be able to contribute more to these communities and their 
                    research by building projects guided by humane paradigms so that Web 3.0 might 
                    correct the mistakes of Web 2.0. That's why I joined Savvy's coding bootcamp: to 
                    help me develop the skills that I need so that I can play a small part in bringing to 
                    life some of the promising ideas that I've read about.
